           <h3>For this assignment I wanted to try and create a sort of relaxing visual
                accompaniment to one of my favorite piano pieces, "omake pfadlib" by Hiroyuki Sawano.
               Whenever I listen to this piece I visualize cooler colors and softer movement at the beginning, with
               more intense and frenzied movement coming in as the song becomes more emotional. I also experimented
               with transitioning into more warmer, passionate tones as the music progresses. The entire song
               is about 3 minutes long, so unfortunately this isn't a fully choreographed live-coding session, but I hope I was
            able to achieve a little bit of the mesmerizing/relaxing atmosphere I was going for. Technically,
        I wanted to focus on creating fluid, more natural-movement, with some randomization in the color and movement
    either being based on time or on the audio.<h3>
        <br>
        <h3>The feedback I received about this coding session matched more or less with what I was going for - my partner 
            described it as having a "calm aesthetic", with movement and ripples that resembled water - which I wasn't actually going for,
            but it works in my favor. I also thought it was interesting how he saw the transition from cool to warm colors as one from water to fire,
            as opposed to just a reflection of the transition from slower to more intense music.

        <h3>I was really inspired by the mesmerizing movement of squares and diamond shapes across the screen that occurred
            when playing around with the Vidiot, so my aim for this assignment was to try to replicate those kinds of shapes,
            along with pleasing color palette choices. My favorite thing about the Vidiot was how tactile it was though - there
            is something very satisfying about turning physical knobs and pressing buttons and creating a new and unique animation at each move.
            Therefore, I tried to make as many options for changing the animation available to the user as I could in limited time.
            If there is something I wish I had really added, it would've been the option to change the animation shapes entirely from squares
            and diamonds to lines and clearer waves.<h3>
     <br>
     <h3>The feedback I received about this animation commented mostly on how much the animations focused on the crisscrossing of lines
         and squares, as well as how the combonation of colors and lines complement each other. One viewer commented that it was a little
        difficult to discern what some of the controls' Vidiot equivalents were, which is unfortunate but not unexpected, as I found it difficult to draw exact
        comparisons between specific controls myself. Another viewer commented that he really enjoyed the aesthetic and the "stacking" effect of the grids and boxes created, which
        I was very happy to hear, and suggested including some blur around the edges of the animation and more definition of the vertical lines to improve the overall look. If 
        I were to go in and revise this project, I'd focus more on creating clearer and more distinct animations, as well as isolating and manipulating variables that have a more 
        obvious effect on the animation so as to make the experience of interacting with the interface more satisfying for viewers and whoever wanted to use this tool.
