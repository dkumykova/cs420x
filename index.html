           <h2>Assignment 1: Shader Live Coding</h2>

           <h3>For this assignment I wanted to try and create a sort of relaxing visual
               accompaniament to one of my favorite piano pieces, "omake pfadlib" by Hiroyuki Sawano.
               Whenever I listen to this piece I visualize cooler colors and softer movement at the beginning, with
               more intense and frenzied movement coming in as the song becomes more emotional. I also experimented
               with transitioning into more warmer, passionate tones as the music progresses. The entire song
               is about 3 minutes long, so unfortunately this isn't a fully choreographed live-coding session, but I hope I was
            able to achieve a little bit of the mesmerizeing/relaxing atmosphere I was going for. Technically,
        I wanted to focus on creating fluid, more natural-movement, with some randomization in the color and movement
    either being based on time or on the audio.<h3>
