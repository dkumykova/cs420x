           <h3>For this assignment I wanted to try and create a sort of relaxing visual
                accompaniment to one of my favorite piano pieces, "omake pfadlib" by Hiroyuki Sawano.
               Whenever I listen to this piece I visualize cooler colors and softer movement at the beginning, with
               more intense and frenzied movement coming in as the song becomes more emotional. I also experimented
               with transitioning into more warmer, passionate tones as the music progresses. The entire song
               is about 3 minutes long, so unfortunately this isn't a fully choreographed live-coding session, but I hope I was
            able to achieve a little bit of the mesmerizing/relaxing atmosphere I was going for. Technically,
        I wanted to focus on creating fluid, more natural-movement, with some randomization in the color and movement
    either being based on time or on the audio.<h3>
        <br>
        <h3>The feedback I received about this coding session matched more or less with what I was going for - my partner 
            described it as having a "calm aesthetic", with movement and ripples that resembled water - which I wasn't actually going for,
            but it works in my favor. I also thought it was interesting how he saw the transition from cool to warm colors as one from water to fire,
            as opposed to just a reflection of the transition from slower to more intense music.
